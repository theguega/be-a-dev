## Adding New Dotfiles and Software

### Dotfiles

Dotfiles are managed using GNU Stow, which is a symbolic link manager that allows you to create symlinks to files and directories. To add a new dotfile, simply create a new file in the `dotfiles` directory and run the `stow` command to create the symlink.

### Sotfware

Software is managed using Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS.
To add a new package to the list, you can edit the `homebrew/Brewfile`.

On Ubuntu, i have used Ansible to manage software installations to be able to be idempotent.
